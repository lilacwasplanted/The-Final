             It is a Zodiac Calculator. 
             To work the app, you'd have to input the day you were born, then click the month of your birthday.
             After that, it will display your Zodiac Sign, your house, your complementary colors, element sign, and ruling planet. 
             Along with other signs you'd be compatable with and some common traits among your zodiac.
             This took me roughly 70+ hrs because of small errors that were hard to find and most of this project was copy/paste code so there were a bunch of tiny errors. 
             I eventually found them and now the app works smoothly. </p>
