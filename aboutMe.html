            Hello! Im Lyla and I'm 18 years old. 
            I was born on May 25, 2005 in El Paso, Texas. 
            El Paso is tucked away on the far westside of Texas, on the New Mexico and Mexico borders. 
            I graduated from Burges Early College High School and I ended with 19 college credits. 
            Before moving here I worked at my local Whataburger for a year.

        <p>Here are some photos from my hometown!</p>
